I am a computational psycholinguist interested in compositionality and the boundaries at which it breaks down in human language. Supervised by Professor Jennifer Culbertson (Centre for Language Evolution, University of Edinburgh) and Dr Frank Mollica (University of Melbourne), my doctoral research combines computational modelling, behavioural and machine learning experiments to investigate why people have such a hard time acquiring and processing semi-compositional verb-argument structures.

I also work with Dr Alex Doumas (PPLS, University of Edinburgh) and Dr Martha Lewis (ILLC, University of Amsterdam) on a project exploring systematicity Ã  la Fodor and Pylyshyn (or lack thereof)  in deep neural networks.
